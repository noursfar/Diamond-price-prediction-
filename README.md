## Diamond Price Prediction

### Overview
This project focuses on predicting diamond prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset utilized is derived from the Seaborn library's 'diamonds' dataset, with various features such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and physical dimensions (x, y, z). The aim is to build a predictive model to estimate diamond prices based on these attributes.

### Key Features
- **Data Processing**: Imported essential libraries (NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) and loaded the dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted initial data exploration, including correlation heatmaps and scatter matrix plots to understand relationships between features.
- **Categorical Data Encoding**: Transformed categorical features into numerical using one-hot encoding for better model performance.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Provided descriptive statistics and confidence intervals for key attributes.
- **Feature Engineering**: Identified and dropped features with weak correlation to the target variable (price).
- **3D Visualization**: Plotted key variables in 3D to visualize relationships.
- **Model Building**: Implemented linear regression using both gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent algorithms to minimize the cost function and optimize the model.

### Key Visualizations
- Correlation heatmaps and bar plots showcasing the relationship between different features and the target variable.
- Violin plots to compare data spread and variability among categorical variables.
- 3D scatter plots illustrating the interaction between carat, dimensions, and price.
- Cost function convergence plots for gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent, demonstrating the optimization process.

### Highlights
- The project demonstrates the entire workflow from data loading and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
- It includes a comprehensive statistical summary and visual interpretations of key findings.
- The application of both **gradient descent** and **stochastic gradient descent** provides insights into different optimization techniques.
